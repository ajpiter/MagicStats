# MagicStats

Basketball statistics have numerous publically available datasets. I will be utilizing many of these datasets to practice scrapping data, cleaning data, creating graphics and building models in both R and Python. 

**Projects:**
- **Fultz Magic v Philly:** A single graphic showing the change in Fultz's Game Score over time both with Philly and the Orlando Magic. Pulled before his 2021 injury. 
- **Is Our Rookie Better Than Your Rookie?:** Compares the Magic's Cole Anthony against other members of the 2021 NBA rookie class through numerous ggplot graphs after scrapping and cleaning datasets. 
- **Should the Magic Sign a Point Guard?:** First created immediately following Fultz's injury and before Cole Anthony became the Magic's starting Point Guard. Highlights the Magic's roster of guard replacements using the facet wrap feature in ggplot2.  

**Datasets Utilized:**
* Baksetball Reference Orlando Magic Game Log: https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/ORL/2010/gamelog/
* Stathead GmSc for Orlando Magic Players: https://stathead.com/basketball/pgl_finder.cgi?request=1&match=game&order_by_asc=0&order_by=pts&lg_id=NBA&is_playoffs=N&age_min=0&age_max=99&team_id=ORL&season_start=1&season_end=-1&positions%5B%5D=G&positions%5B%5D=GF&positions%5B%5D=F&positions%5B%5D=FG&positions%5B%5D=FC&positions%5B%5D=C&positions%5B%5D=CF&game_month=0
